                        <p>You may return new and unused items within 20 days of delivery for an exchange or full refund of the purchase price. All refunds will be made in the form of a coupon that can be used for other purchases on our website. Refunds by cheque will be made in cases where we have shipped you an incorrect piece or if the piece that you have received is damaged in transit.</p>
                        <br><br>
                        <p>Shipping and any taxes paid at the customer’s end will not be refunded. All items must be in their original condition to be eligible for a return or exchange.</p>
                        <br><br>
                        <p>The shipping costs for returns and exchanges are the responsibility of the customer although we’ll pay the return shipping costs if the return is a result of our error (you received an incorrect or defective item, etc.).</p>
                        <br><br>
                        <p>You should expect to receive your refund within two weeks of mailing off your package; however, in many cases you will receive a refund more quickly.</p>
                        <br><br>
                        <p>To return an item, simply send us an email at info@attirebw.com with your order number and the reason for the return. Once we send you an authorization email, you may mail us the parcel. We’ll notify you via e-mail of your refund once we’ve received and processed the returned item.</p>
